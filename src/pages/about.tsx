          Here I am, pondering about writing an essay about myself. I'm very
          conscious about the words I choose because I'm very dithering about
          the usefulness of this essay to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          So I decided go full blown ironic and write whatever comes to my mind
          without it needing to be useful to you

          I'm Ambitiously Focused on Creating
        </h2>
        <p>
          I love to make stuff. I want to make essays, books, websites,
          podcasts, companies, systems, apps, relationships, and especially new
          Ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
          And this is the driving force for all the decisions I make in my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also want to learn lots of stuff. I want to stretch, strive and
          grow. I easily connect with people who think the same.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">I love solving problems</h2>
        <p>
          I'm obsessed with thinking deeply about problems. I get a very
          tangible euphoria from thinking deeply about a problem and solving
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          This obsession has made me very good at looking at things logically
          and clearly. I like to think from first principles. And I can usually
          detect bullshit when I see one. Even in me.
        </p>

      <section className="space-y-3">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">I enjoy Self Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          I'm very much into stoicism. And more importantly I love to reflect on
          Akash. It allows me to think clearly, improve myself, detect my own
          bullshits.
        </p>
        <p>
          I make observations about me and those observations are a data about
          me and how I work. And then I utilize it to construct a strategy about
          how to deal with those truths.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's a like debugging, however I'm the detective, victim and the
          murderer!

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">I'm an Experimentalist</h2>
        <p>
          I like to think of myself as an Experimentalist. I love to experiment
          with different approaches to thinking and living.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've learnt that the brain is remarkably responsive to experience. If
          I ask it to exercise every day, it gets better at exercising. If If I
          ask it to worry, it gets better at worrying. If I ask it to
          concentrate, it gets better at concentrating. Not only does it find
          these things easier, but it actually remodels itself based on what I
          ask it to do.

        <ul>
          <li>18 Me: 16 me was so naive. I’m wiser.</li>
          <li>20 Me: 18 me was so naive lol. I’m wiser.</li>
          <li>22 Me: 20 me was so naive lol. I’m wiser</li>
          <li>23 Me: 22 me was so naive.... wait. I’m still naive!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It’s so easier to think that we were in the dark yesterday but we are
          in the light today One thing I’m learning is to learn that I don’t
          know.

      <section className="space-y-3">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">I like to live in Present</h2>
        <p>
          The present moment, no matter how painful, is never unbearable. What
          is unbearable is what I think is going to happen in five hours or in
          five days. This ability to see into the future is a double edged
          sword. So I try not to be anxious about tomorrow, tomorrow will look
          after itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          More importantly, If I respond to “what ifs” I'll get in trouble. So,
          I need to wait some time, let it settle, and then listen very
          carefully to myself.

      <section className="space-y-3">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">I love startups</h2>
        <p>
          Startups represent a weird mix of all things I love in life. Be it
          solving complex problems, dealing with lots of things at once, people,
          finances, systems, etc and hosts of all sorts of wacky things. I love
          it!
        </p>
        <p>
          And you don’t start companies to get rich. You start them for reasons
          you don’t fully understand, and like a runner at the 30th km, often
          question why you subjected yourself to such euphoric misery that is a
          startup.

      <section className="space-y-3">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">I love helping people</h2>
        <p>
          Whatever I want in life, I’ve found that the best way to get it is to
          focus my energy on giving to others. If I want to boost my confidence,
          I look for ways to help someone else feel more confident. If I want to
          feel more hopeful, positive, and inspired, I try to infuse that in
          someone else’s day. If I want more success for myself, the fastest way
          to get it is to go about helping someone else obtain it.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">I like to do what I love</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The money may follow and please me.</li>
          <li>The money may follow but pleases me less that I expected.</li>
          <li>The money may follow but pleases me briefly.</li>
          <li>The money might not follow, which might disappoint me.</li>
          <li>
            But if I'm doing what I love, I will have loved what I've been
            doing. That will satisfy me so deeply that the result must either be
            called success or recognized as something even more enriching.

          I'm learning to embrace failure
        </h2>
        <p>
          Growing up, I had always been told I'm a smart kid. So I'd developed
          this identity that I’m a smart kid. And I would do things that would
          reinforce that identity, and stay away from things that would contrast
          that identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          It made it really hard for me to do anything where other people could
          see how incompetent I am. So I would run away from all sort of
          experiences that would make me feel kinda silly or incompetent. And
          that actually paralyzed me because for most things in life, you’ll
          suck in the beginning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually, I learned that the world actually rewards experience and
          competence. So, I am learning to reframe my thinking from smart/stupid
          to experienced / inexperienced. And the More I can realise that my
          success has nothing to do with intelligence, rather with the
          experience / inexperience and the degree of competence I have, the
          better off I’m going to be. The more I realise that, the more
          naturally I’d want to try things and be okay failing at those things.

          I believe happiness is really a default state. Happiness is there when
