            This year I made a decision to try living a nomadic lifestyle. I
            decided to start with Bali, Indonesia. And then Pandemic happened
            and I'm stuck here. Wait, I'm happy to be stuck here. I'll write
            more about my trip to Bali soon.

            At the start of this year I had decided to work on this project,{" "}
            <ExternalLink href="https://comrade.chat" label="Comrade" />. It's a
            browser extension that allows people to chat on any website. It's
            like if discord & intercom had a baby.

            But then, life happened to me and I decided to put it on hold.
            Recently I've decided to work on that again.

            Thinking about setting up a Coaching Business
          </h2>
          <p>
            Lot of people have told me that I help them bring clarity. So, I
            want to dabble in this. Iâ€™m thinking about building a new coaching
            business where I help people bring extreme clarity in their business
            and make them face their bullshit so they can move forward better
            with clear steps.
