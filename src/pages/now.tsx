          Thinking about setting up a Coaching Business
        </h2>
        <p>
          Lot of people have told me that I help them bring clarity. So, I want
          to dabble in this. Iâ€™m thinking about building a new coaching business
          where I help people bring extreme clarity in their business and make
          them face their bullshit so they can move forward better with clear
          steps.
