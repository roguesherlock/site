When you find yourself hesitant, always yield to Action. Action. Action.

One thing I learnt recently is that I was caught up in this vicious cycle. I was hesitant because I am not used to things going my way. And things would never go my way because I remain hesitant. I see what I want, become hesitant, and the door of opportunity closes. It happens again. And again. And again. With each choice towards inaction, I reject myself a little bit more.

_So how did I get out?_

I realised that the choice of **Inaction** is more painful than **Action**.
