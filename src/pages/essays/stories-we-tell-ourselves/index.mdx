<!-- We're extremely risk averse -->

_“I don’t think I’m smart enough to do that”_

_“I don’t think I can ever learn a new language”_

_“I just give up”_

_“I can’t do this anymore”_

_“I’m just not that kind of person”_

_“It just doesn’t resonate with me”_

_“My personality doesn’t match with that”_

_“I don’t think I can ever do that”_

It’s this narrative that we buy into because it’s just so. damn. easy. And facing the alternative is just brutal raw hard truth, that you can do anything you want, be anyone you want to be. Because doing that would require hard work, and lot of sacrifices. Because doing it would require us to be out of our comfort zone all the damn time. Because that goal seems like a unsurmountable mountain and would require trekking 1000s of steps to reach there. We’re extremely risk averse by default.
