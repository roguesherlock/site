<!-- let's talk about why you're unhappy -->

<!--more-->

I have been thinking about this for quite some time and I’d like to share some of my thoughts. Now, before I lay down my thoughts I'd like to state that everyone has/should have their own definition of Happiness.

I think it's a very tricky question to answer directly so I'd invert the question and try to answer what is unhappiness. And maybe then we'll figure out what happiness is. More specifically, I want to dwell on what causes unhappiness because we all have a general idea of what is unhappiness.

I believe there’s only one cause of unhappiness, it’s these false beliefs that we have in our head. Think of them like grooves, formed by persistent affirmations from your environment over a long period of time.

And, what are these beliefs that I’m talking about?

1. You cannot be happy without the things that you’re attached to and that you consider so precious. False. There is not a single moment in your life when you do not have everything that you need to be happy. The reason why you are so unhappy is because you are focusing on what you do not have rather than on what you have right now. I want you to think about that for a minute.

2. Happiness is in the future. False. Right here and now you are happy and you do not know it because of your false beliefs in your head. And your distorted perceptions have got you caught up in fears, anxieties, attachments, conflicts and host of games that you’re programmed to play.

3. Happiness will come if you manage to change the situation you are in and the people around you. False. What makes you happy or unhappy is not the world and the people around you, but the thinking in your head. Do you realize that you could have the finest looks, most attractive body, the most charming personality, and the most pleasant of surroundings and still be unhappy? So if it is happiness that you seek you can stop wasting your energy trying to cure your baldness or build up an attractive body or change your residence or job or community or lifestyle or even your personality.

4. If all your desires are fulfilled you will be happy. False. In fact it is these very desires and attachments that make you tense, frustrated, nervous, insecure and fearful.

Now, when you understand your unhappiness, it will disappear; What results is a state I called happiness.

And lastly, I believe happiness can’t be desired. Because if you desire happiness you will be anxious lest you do not attain it. You will be constantly in a state of dissatisfaction; and dissatisfaction and anxiety kill the very happiness that they set out to gain.

Alright Akash, that's all fine and dandy, but how do I attain happiness. What actions should I take to be happy?
Here's the thing, you don't need to take any actions. It doesn't require any effort. All you need to do is just observe. Observe yourself. Observe your beliefs. And change in you will come naturally. And observation is as effortless as breathing.
